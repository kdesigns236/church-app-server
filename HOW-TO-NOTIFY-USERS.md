## 📊 Tracking Update Adoption

### Check Who Updated:

The new app (v2.1.0) sends version headers. You can check server logs to see:

**Old app users:** No version header in requests
**New app users:** `X-App-Version: 2.1.0` in headers

### Monitor in Render Logs:

Look for requests with/without version headers to estimate adoption rate.
