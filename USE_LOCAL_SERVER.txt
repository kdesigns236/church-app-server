🔧 TEMPORARY FIX: Use Local Server

Your Render server might be cached. To test locally:

1. Edit .env file:
   Change: VITE_API_URL=https://church-app-server.onrender.com/api
   To: VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api

2. Restart your frontend (it should auto-reload)

3. Test chat - should work with local server!

4. To fix Render:
   - Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
   - Click "Manual Deploy" → "Clear build cache & deploy"
   - Wait 2-3 minutes
   - Change .env back to: VITE_API_URL=https://church-app-server.onrender.com/api

Your local server is already running on port 3001!
