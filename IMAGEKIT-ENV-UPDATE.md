# ImageKit Environment Variable Update

## Server .env File

Add this line to `server/.env`:

```
IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY=private_4SqrpJluMMXKA6BoIIVkEE/Nf94=
```

This is already hardcoded in the server code as a fallback, but it's better to have it in the .env file for security.

## Done!

The ImageKit integration is complete!
